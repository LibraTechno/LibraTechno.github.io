        <h1 class="heading">About Us</h1>
        <h3>Our company</h3>
        <p><strong>Libra Techno</strong> is an amalgam of offline and online experience and skills, and is poised to become a major player in the software, web solutions, media & content, and design businesses. Very few companies in the world have the combination of diverse but related expertise that we have.</p>
        <h3>Our values</h3>
        <h5 class="sub-heading">Ethics</h5>
        <p><strong>Libra Techno</strong> believes in doing business the ethical way. Some well-wishers have asked us why we don't become more "pragmatic" and build our revenues by hook or by crook. We'd rather be small.</p>
        <h5 class="sub-heading">Customer focus</h5>
        <p>At <strong>Libra Techno</strong> we believe that we are there because of the customer. We even have heated arguments with some customers on strategic as well as design issues, because we believe it is our job to get them to do their best. We haven't lost any customers because of our argumentativeness. We believe we are successful when our customers make business gains. We have actually refused assignments because we felt that the potential customers were adopting an approach that would not get them results.</p>
        <h5 class="sub-heading">Quality assurance</h5>
        <p>We believe that if we should take up client assignments only if we can deliver quality. We have, in many cases, not taken up assignments because the potential clients were willing to pay so little that we could not provide the quality that we would be happy with, regardless of what the client would be happy with. We have also refused to bid for projects whenever we felt that we did not have the capabilities to deliver or to deliver on time.</p>
        <h5 class="sub-heading">Organisational culture</h5>
        <p><strong>Libra Techno</strong> is an equal-opportunity employer, in which people from different ethnic and religious backgrounds work together as one.<br/>We work informally, as a flat organisation in which every  member of the staff has a right to an opinion that may turn out to be more correct than that of the managing director, and in which compartments dissolve into project teams.</p>
        <h5 class="sub-heading">Learning organisation</h5>
        <p>We have spent years on research and on learning - and then some more on R&D to develop new applications in our areas of operation. We are constantly checking out new technologies, evaluating them, and picking what suits us and our customers.<br/>We aim to be at least a couple of steps ahead of our customers so that we can surprise them with delivery of more than they expect. </p>
        <h5 class="sub-heading">Ambition</h5>
        <p>We believe in pushing the envelope in everything we do. We aim to be one of the biggest companies in the world in each of our areas of operation. The only limits we acknowledge are ethics and legality.</p>
