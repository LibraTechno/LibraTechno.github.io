            Importance of Software Testing
        </h4>
        <p>
            A software is tested before deployment to identify and rectify defects. It also verifies that all requirements are implemented correctly. This makes the software more predictable in behavior by improving quality and reliability. From a broader perspective, testing helps in marketability of the software and retention of customers.

            QA Procedures and Software Testing
        </h4>
        <p>
            Software bugs or errors cost around $60 billion to the US economy every year. The Indian IT-related services market is expected to touch the $20 billion mark by next year. Software testing will form a major share of the earnings.<br>Opportunities are endless. The market is expanding every day. IT giants get a considerable portion of their revenues from Testing projects. Software Testing is a highly sought after department. Another thing to remember is that a software is never tested by the company that develops the same. So, testing has to performed by an independent company.
        </p>
        <p>
            Testing is treated as a highly specialized service and is a standalone department. At Libra Technono, we too have a separate, highly efficient Testing unit that, with full dedication and expertise, steers every project to success.
