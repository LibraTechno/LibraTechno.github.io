            What makes a great web site design?
        </h4>
        <p>
            A great design is one that aids in selling the product or service the business offers. If the web design detracts from the content or surrounds the content with noisy, flashy graphics the message will be lost. Great web design starts with developing a web site strategy and then developing the content, marketing, and features of the site around the web site strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the web site strategy is developed the process then includes web site development which starts with understanding usability and knowing how to place content, links, and other features into their proper locations. Without this the site will fail to be great. Studying successful sites like Amazon and Microsoft will always lead the developer into a great creation.

            Our Web Site Design Process
        </h4>
        <h5 class="sub-sub-heading">
            Web Site Design Consultation
        </h5>
        <p>
            During the initial web design consultation we determine the goals of the site, the target market (e.g., business to business, business to consumer), and information about the business.
        </p>
        <h5 class="sub-sub-heading">
            Web Site Design Research
        </h5>
        <p>
            During this process we determine, with the aid of the client, the major competition. If they have web sites, we review those web sites to determine what they do right and wrong.
        </p>
        <h5 class="sub-sub-heading">
            Web Site Strategy
        </h5>
        <p>
            At this point we have a reasonable amount of information about the client and the products or services being offered. This is our springboard in developing a cohesive web site strategy. Without this we have realized more times than not that our designs falter. We are also able to review web sites and find their faults because we understand strategies and how to get the visitors to look in certain places for information. Moving that information destroys the strategy.
        </p>
        <h5 class="sub-sub-heading">
            Web Site Design
        </h5>
        <p>
            We design the entire site based upon the presented ideas and concepts accepted by the client. This includes all the graphics, database layout and design, and other programming required for the site to work correctly. This is the last step that changes will be accepted.
        </p>
        <h5 class="sub-sub-heading">
            Web Site Development
        </h5>
        <p>
            During this step we set the site to go live and ready for business. Depending upon the elements of design the site may partially be up and running. We have had great success with getting our clients in the search engines if the site is hosted on our servers prior to full deployment with links from our web site's portfolio page. We have actually had one client that was listed number one for their keywords on the day the site went live.
