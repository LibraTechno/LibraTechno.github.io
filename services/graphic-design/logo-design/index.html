            Logo Design Process :
        </h4>
        <h5 class="sub-sub-heading">Step 1 - Design Analysis</h5>
        <p>
            Before we start on your logo design, we ask a few questions about your business, as well as any ideas that you would like expressed in your logo. We also talk to you about the type of image that you might be looking for, and we will ask you if there are other images that you like the look of. This will ensure that the design drafts we come up with are suitable and accurately reflect the nature of your business.During the initial web design consultation we determine the goals of the site, the target market (e.g., business to business, business to consumer), and information about the business.
        </p>
        <h5 class="sub-sub-heading">Step 2 - Draft Development</h5>
        <p>
            Based on your brief, we return via email 6-8 draft ideas and ask for your feedback. We ask you to be as honest as possible as it is important that you end up with something that you are 100% happy with. It also will help us to reduce the design time.
        </p>
        <h5 class="sub-sub-heading">Step 3 - Make Your Choices</h5>
        <p>
            In the feedback that you provide on the draft ideas, we ask that you select one or two ideas for us to work with. We can then provide variations on these ideas for further feedback. The logo design package includes up to 4 sets of variations, including revision on a final design (see Step 4).
        </p>
        <h5 class="sub-sub-heading">Step 4 - Revision</h5>
        <p>
            Revision of the final design includes minor variations such as colour and font.
        </p>
        <h5 class="sub-sub-heading">Step 5 - Your Logo is Ready</h5>
        <p>
            The final step is to set up your file with the correct PMS colours for accurate printing, and also to create the digital files for the web and desktop publishing. We supply you with a copy of your logo on CD in EPS/CDR/AI format for printing and rescaling, and GIF/JPG/PNG format for web applications. (Other formats are available upon request).
